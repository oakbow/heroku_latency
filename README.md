with this application, you are able to the latency between heroku and you.

heroku is an server environment which is known as PaaS.
you are able to deloy your code and maintain your services without lower costs of server maintainance.
but Heroku is an American company and it has only 2 regions, us(around Boston?) and eu(around somewher? please let me know if you know).
so most of people need to care about the latency between their place to live and the heroku region.

please check the latency with this plane Raiils app without logics, just hello world.
you are able to consider if heroku is worth to use for your services at the point of view of latency
